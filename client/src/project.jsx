                        I implemented both the knowledge I learned throughout the course and online inspiration. 
                        The idea was to make a personalized website for real estate agents with listings, contacts, and a biography of the individual.
                        The project ended up giving me a good mark and chance to display me learning.</p>

                        It allowed me to hone on my leadership skills as I led the charge in organization and planning like you would in a database.
                        As developers, we should not only focus on the code aspect but also the human part as well.</p>
